=== FUM-Elect User Interface Microservice ===

This is a key componenet in our FUM Election microservice project. It is written with Node Js and Express.js . It provides us a web based user interface that allows us to create elections and vote in our FUM election Service. But this module is more than an interface, all the validation take place here, so if you want to deploy your projects in real world, you shouldn't expose the API on other modules to the out world. 
This module tries to connect to Authentication Service, Election Manager Service, Election Panel Service on configured addresses and ports. you cand see and change this addresses in the config/config.js file.
